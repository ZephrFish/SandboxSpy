## Known Issues

### Test Coverage Gaps
1. Server package needs unit tests
2. Client package needs unit tests  
3. Middleware package needs unit tests

### Minor Issues
1. Docker daemon not running locally (expected)
2. Some files could benefit from additional comments

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Add unit tests for server package (0% coverage)
2. Add unit tests for client package (0% coverage)
3. Add integration tests for full client-server flow

### Medium Priority
1. Add unit tests for middleware package
2. Increase detector package coverage to 80%+
3. Add end-to-end tests

### Low Priority
1. Add more benchmark tests
2. Consider adding fuzzing tests for security validators
3. Add performance profiling

## Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY with caveats

The SandboxSpy system is functional and includes:
- Comprehensive sandbox detection with 15+ methods
- Secure client-server architecture
- Multiple export formats
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Strong security features

Main areas for improvement:
- Server and client packages need unit tests
- Overall test coverage could be improved from 38.9%

The system is ready for deployment but would benefit from additional testing, especially for the server components.
