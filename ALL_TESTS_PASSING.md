# All Tests Now Pass! ðŸŽ‰

## Summary
Successfully fixed all failing tests in the SandboxSpy project. The test suite is now fully functional with 100% pass rate.

## Test Results

### Package Test Status
| Package | Tests | Status | Coverage |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|
| **pkg/client** | 10 | âœ… All Pass | 38.3% |
| **pkg/detector** | All | âœ… All Pass | 65.5% |
| **pkg/middleware** | 12 | âœ… All Pass | 86.8% |
| **pkg/security** | All | âœ… All Pass | 85.7% |
| **pkg/server** | 17 | âœ… All Pass | 71.8% |

## Coverage Improvements
- **Overall Coverage**: 30.0%
- **Middleware**: Improved from 81.0% to 86.8%
- **Server**: Improved from 70.8% to 71.8%

## Fixes Applied

### 1. CORS Headers Test Fix
**Problem**: Routes didn't accept OPTIONS method, returning 405 Method Not Allowed
**Solution**: Added OPTIONS method to all API routes
```go
api.HandleFunc("/health", s.handleHealth).Methods("GET", "OPTIONS")
```

### 2. Export Formats Test Fix
**Problem**: Test was failing due to initialization issues
**Solution**: Properly initialized server and added error handling

### 3. Rate Limiter Test Fix
**Problem**: Rate limiter burst calculation was incorrect
**Solution**: Used AddLimiterWithBurst with precise burst control
```go
sm.rateLimiter.AddLimiterWithBurst("default", 1, time.Minute, 1)
```

## Final Test Execution

- âœ… Middleware package: 12/12 tests passing  
- âœ… Client package: 10/10 tests passing
- âœ… Security package: All tests passing
- âœ… Detector package: All tests passing

## Critical Package Coverage
